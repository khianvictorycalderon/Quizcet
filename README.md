# Quizcet: RSQ *(Review Self-Quiz)*
A web-based review self quiz system that let's you create questions and mock tests and quizzes.

## Purpose
Initially developed for my personal use of reviewing lessons in college.

## Installation
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/khianvictorycalderon/Quizcet.git`
2. Either directly open `index.html` or use `live server` from VS code.
3. Go and enjoy reviewing lessons!

## Usage
1. Create a subject.
2. In that subject, create a series of questions you want to review.
3. Either you can review all subjects or just one subject.
4. Questions are in random order, so goodluck!
5. Once a semester (for college) or quarter (for highschool and elementary) ends, you can delete the subject and its questions.
6. Remember, subjects name should be unique and cannot have duplicate names, this is to avoid confusion.
7. You can export and import questions in `.json` file or `text-based` format so you can have your backup or import it into another devices.
